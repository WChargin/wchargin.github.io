      <p>
      Java is the language I'm most comfortable in.
      I'm an advanced user of Java&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;7, and I'm decently proficient with the new features of Java&nbsp;8.
      I know how to use all the core standard libraries, including Swing and AWT, threading, and networking.
      I'm also familiar with the MiG Layout GUI layout manager, which I love.
      </p>
      <p>
      My IDE of choice for Java work is Eclipse, which I also know cold.

    <div class="skill-explanation" id="skill-python">
      <p>
      Python is my go-to scripting language.
      I've written everything from file format converters to web parsers.
      I'm a big fan of list comprehensions, zipping, and the other features that give Python its elegance.
      I know both Python 2 and 3.
      </p>

      <p>
      I'm also somewhat familiar with the NumPy and matplotlib libraries, which I prefer over MATLAB due to their portability and, of course, price.

    </div>
    <div class="skill-explanation" id="skill-c">
      <p>
      C is my preferred language for computationally intensive programs.
      I'm comfortable with all the core language features, including more advanced concepts like high-order pointers, dynamic memory management, function pointers, and all that good stuff.
      My personal policy is to compile everything under <code>-W -Wall</code> and never rest until the code is warning-free.

      The terminal is my home.
      For me, nothing can beat the raw productivity of direct access to the system.
      I love a good GNU/Linux environment; my operating system of choice is Linux&nbsp;Mint, but I'm also familiar with Ubuntu, and can find my way around a Red&nbsp;Hat system.
      I can write a decent Bash script, too, and I'm familiar with some of the more advanced Bash features like reverse i-search, brace expansion, and event designators.

    <div class="skill-explanation" id="skill-git">
      <p>
      Git and GitHub are amazing tools.
      I set up a Git repository for most of my non-trivial projects, and often use GitHub for hosting.
      I'm a fan of Git Flow for larger projects.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-explanation" id="skill-latex">
      <p>
      I've been using <img src="latex-inline.png" class="inline-image" alt="LaTeX" /> for pretty much everything for a while now.
      In addition to basic text, I'm comfortable with typesetting code listings, algorithms and pseudocode, diagrams (with Ti<i>k</i>Z), graphs and plots (with pgfplots), publication-quality tables, and, of course, precisely formatted mathematics.
      I've also written a few packages and document classes for personal use.

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
  Of course, I'm proficient in all the standard office suites (Microsoft Office, Google Drive, and LibreOffice, my preference being either of the latter).
  Here are some more interesting applications that I know.

      <p>
      I use Blender for all my 3D work.
      I'm a fairly advanced user, comfortable with modeling, sculpting, designing materials, compositing, and creating simulations.
      I've set up a render farm with 35 computers using the Network Render addon in Blender, so there's that, too.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-explanation" id="skill-vim">
      <p>
      Vim is amazing.
      It truly lets me edit at &ldquo;the speed of thought.&rdquo;
      I use Vim for all my code except Java projects, and its speed and productivity are truly unrivaled.
      The <img src="latex-inline.png" class="inline-image" alt="LaTeX" />-Suite (a.k.a. Vim-<img src="latex-inline.png" class="inline-image" alt="LaTeX" />) plugin is super handy, too.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over 20% of the commands I run on my terminal are to start Vim.
      (My next most common command is <code>cd</code>, at under 10%.)
