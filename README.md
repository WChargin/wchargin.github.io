Hi! You've found the source code for [my website][].

This is a static site with content rendered in [React][], with [Aphrodite][] for styling.
It works perfectly without JavaScript.

I&nbsp;used to have client-side routing and resource preloading on hover, but client-side navigations to long articles caused notable scripting delays on lower-end devices.
Full page loads are simpler and donâ€™t require setting up code splitting to keep the bundle size in check as the total content increases.
At time of writing, each page is under 15&thinsp;KB gzipped, anyway.

I'm pleased to report that it took me **fewer than one thousand hours** to configure webpack, babel, and friends to do what I wanted.

That's about it. It's MIT licensed; feel free to grab anything that you find interesting.
