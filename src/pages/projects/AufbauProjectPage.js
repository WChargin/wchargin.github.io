            <Heading level={2}>Overview</Heading>
            <p>
                When I&nbsp;was offered the position of Instructional Student
                Assistant for introductory CS&nbsp;courses at Cal&nbsp;Poly,
                I&nbsp;found that the existing autograding system was a fragile
                jumble of giant, monolithic Bash scripts. The scripts were
                still working, but just barely, and adding any of the desired
                new functionality would have been asking for trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                To remedy this, I&nbsp;designed a modular grading system, based
                on the premise that any grading process can be broken down into
                a sequence of discrete steps. For example, the process for
                grading a Java assignment might be as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy student's source files to the grading directory.</li>
                <li>Copy the test driver to the grading directory.</li>
                <li>Compile the source files with <tt>javac</tt>.</li>
                <li>Run the test driver, and make sure that it passes.</li>
                <li>Deduct points for overly long lines.</li>
                <li>Deduct points for tab characters.</li>
                <li>Deduct points for incomplete documentation.</li>
                <li>Email scores to students.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Most of these steps are not specific to any one assignment, or
                even any one programming language. By writing each of these
                steps independently, it becomes trivially easy to create
                assignment specifications that can be automatically executed.
            </p>
            <Heading level={2}>Features</Heading>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Support for multiple grading periods, and penalties for
                    late submissions or repeated submissions (partial credit).
                    This includes a tool to extract each student&rsquo;s best
                    score and export the results as CSV for easy input into a
                    gradebook.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration with cron via a configurable schedule file that
                    lists upcoming assignments, grading periods, and
                    parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Language bindings for steps written in Bash and Python,
                    with the option of easy expansion to other languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Wide variety of built-in steps, including:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            simple file manipulation scripts (e.g., &ldquo;copy
                            files from the student directory to the testing
                            directory&rdquo;);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a custom Javadoc doclet to automatically check and
                            score documentation;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            style checking tools for long lines, tab
                            characters, etc.;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a runner for Java test drivers; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            utility to mail scores and deduction explanations
                            to students.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    And, of course, comprehensive documentation for
                    instructors and new student graders.
                </li>
            </ul>

                My system is in use by Computer Science 102 classes at
                Cal&nbsp;Poly.

            <p>
                Unfortunately, Cal&nbsp;Poly requires that the source code for
                this project remain private. Sorry.
