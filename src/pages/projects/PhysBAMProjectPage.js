            <p>
                In this project, I&nbsp;implemented a variety of physical
                simulations on a low-powered Android tablet. The main goal of
                this project was to look for ways to increase the algorithmic
                efficiency of the simulations. The temptation with physics
                simulations is generally to purchase more or better hardware,
                so limiting myself to a low-powered tablet made more diverse
                techniques necessary. Additionally, it was always a goal to be
                entirely physically accurate, never sacrificing accuracy for
                speed.

                The simulations implemented in the application include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>articulated rigid body;</li>
                <li>cloth simulation;</li>
                <li>smoke simulation (voxel density); and</li>
                <li>dynamic paint via displacement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <Link href={urls.writeup}>My research writeup</Link> is also

                Some things accomplished during the course of this project
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    efficient collision detection for rigid bodies, via
                    manual collision groups;
                </li>
                <li>
                    efficient quadtree-based collision detection for
                    arbitrarily dense urban environments;
                </li>
                <li>
                    efficient joint constraint solution for arbitrarily
                    structured articulated rigid bodies;
                </li>
                <li>
                    inclusion of partially or fully pre-baked expensive
                    simulations such as cloth and smoke (based in finite
                    element analysis), modified for current environment;
                </li>
                <li>
                    support for realistic rendering features, such as
                    camera-dependent fog and UV-mapped textures on both height
                    maps and triangulated meshes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Some of the libraries upon which this project relies utilize
                state-of-the-art techniques from papers that have not yet been
                published. For this reason, I&nbsp;have been asked not to make
                the source code publicly available.
