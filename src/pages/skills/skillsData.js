            I’ve enjoyed using Python professionally since&nbsp;2014, and personally since around&nbsp;2011.
            It’s my almost-exclusive tool of choice for exploring a data set and for most one-off scripts or tasks.
            I’m consistently impressed by Python’s design: the abstractions that the language core chooses to support always seem to have a deceptively high power-to-weight ratio, and of course the standard libraries are excellent and abundant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of my work on the Khan&nbsp;Academy website is in&nbsp;Python.
            Of that work, much is related to the core site infrastructure (in particular, the content model), to the streaks functionality, and to the thumbnails system.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies include chaining decorators, doing terrifying things with metaclasses, and linking people to <Link href={urls.hasattr}>“<tt>hasattr</tt>: a dangerous misnomer.”</Link>

            I&nbsp;tend to use git for the vast majority of my work, even if I&nbsp;don’t intend to push it to any remote.
            My workflow is to rebase aggressively: I&nbsp;prefer to keep a clean history where each commit is atomic, minimal, and has no lint errors or test failures, instead of a more literal recording of my keystrokes.
            For example, I&nbsp;recently <Link href={urls.megarebase}>fixed all lint errors in every commit of a (local-only) repository</Link> easily via an interactive rebase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, I&nbsp;prefer to keep coarse-grained branches, corresponding more to “project” than “feature,” so that I&nbsp;can more easily curate that history by bouncing around in a rebase.

            For example, I’ve used its powerful image compositing tools to perform batch transformations, used it as a simple cross-platform standalone video editor, and used its modeling and animation tools to mock up designs.
            It’s a beautiful and versatile software package that many developers could probably benefit from learning.

            Many people have asked me for my <code>.vimrc</code>&nbsp;file.
            To new users of vim, I always respond that{" "} <Link href={urls.vimrc}>my <code>.vimrc</code>&nbsp;file is on GitHub</Link>, and that they should feel totally free to <em>read</em> from it, and to <em>type</em> any portions of it into their own <code>.vimrc</code>&nbsp;files, but <em>not</em> to paste things in directly.
            The point of the file is to enable you to configure vim how you want it; if you don’t learn how to do that, you’ll be shirking its potential.
