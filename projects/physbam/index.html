<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this project, I implemented a variety of physical simulations on a low-powered Android tablet.
The main goal of this project was to look for ways to increase the algorithmic efficiency of the simulations.
The temptation with physics simulations is generally to purchase more or better hardware, so limiting myself to a low-powered tablet made more out-of-the-box thinking necessary.
Additionally, it was always a goal to be entirely physically accurate, never sacrificing accuracy for speed.

The simulations implemented in the application include:
<ul>
  <li>Articulated rigid body</li>
  <li>Cloth simulation</li>
  <li>Smoke simulation (voxel density)</li>
  <li>Dynamic paint via displacement</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
Some things accomplished during the course of this project include:
<ul>
  <li>Efficient collision detection for rigid bodies, by setting manual collision groups.</li>
  <li>Efficient collision detection scheme for arbitrarily dense urban environments, using a <i>k</i>-d tree and two-dimensional bitfield.</li>
  <li>Efficient joint constraint solving for arbitrarily structured articulated rigid bodies.</li>
  <li>Novel algorithm for distributing points on the surface of an arbitrary 3D triangulated mesh with UV map and corresponding density function, based in part on concepts from the Metropolis algorithm.</li>
  <li>Inclusion of partially or fully pre-baked expensive simulations such as cloth and smoke (based in finite element analysis), modified for current environment.</li>
  <li>Support for realistic rendering features, such as camera-dependent fog and UV-mapped textures on both height maps and triangulated meshes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<p>
I've prepared <a href="https://vimeo.com/103361487">this demonstration reel</a> to exhibit some of the features described above.
