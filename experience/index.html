    <h2 id="ahpcrc">AHPCRC Summer Institute</h2>
    <p>
    I conducted research and studied at the <a href="http://ahpcrc.stanford.edu/">Army High Performance Computing Research Center</a> during the 2014 Summer Institute at Stanford University.
    During these eight weeks, I studied various topics in math, computer science, and engineering, including optimization, partial differential equations, and computational mesh generation.
    I also worked on research, developing real-time physics simulations on low-powered Android tablets (see the <a href="/projects/physbam/">relevant project page</a> for more information).
    As part of this research, I developed a novel algorithm for distribution of points on a 3D triangulated mesh, following a provided UV density function.
    I received a verbal commendation on the excellence of my research report (available <a href="/files/ahpcrc_writeup.pdf">here</a>).

    <h2 id="lcm">League of Creative Minds</h2>
    <p>
    I worked with the <a href="http://lcmmun.org/">League of Creative Minds</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations">Model UN</a> debate organization, from 2011&ndash;2014, both as a student and as a secretariat member.
    </p>
    <p>
    As Undersecretary-General of Technology and Innovation, my work included audio/visual setup, networking, communications, and more.
    I developed Kiosk to fix some of the problems I saw arise (see the <a href="/projects/kiosk/">relevant project page</a> for more information), and earned the Model Diplomat award for its creation.
    I also delivered scientific and technical presentations to students in preparation for debates.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a student, I was also Head Delegate for two years.
    I won the Best Delegate award at WEMUN 2011 in Beijing, and the Most Persuasive Delegate award at MUNOS 2011 in Seoul.
