    <h2 id="ahpcrc">Khan Academy</h2>
    <p>
    During the summer of 2015, I&nbsp;worked at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> on a few web frontend and backend projects.
    Specifically,&nbsp;I
    <ul>
        <li>added support to our CMS for content creators to upload content thumbnails, implemented server-side compositing of these images, and used the composited thumbnails throughout our site and on YouTube;</li>
        <li>productionized and rolled out a new video player, both to grant more immediate control of the playback (e.g., with a prominent speed selector whose value persists across page loads), and also to lay the ground work for more in-video content in the future;</li>
        <li>implemented streaks (&agrave;&nbsp;la Duolingo) to encourage deep, exploratory learning (as opposed to just-in-time test prep) and to increase user engagement;</li>
        <li>implemented hot loading of JSX and CSS/Less files to dramatically improve developer productivity by cutting down on iteration time; and</li>
        <li>improved our content publish process performance by&nbsp;17%, primarily by memoizing tree traversals, and then by another&nbsp;48% by decreasing the complexity of one expensive step from <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;<i>m</i>) to&nbsp; <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&thinsp;+&thinsp;<i>m</i>).</li>
    </ul>
    We use Python with Google App&nbsp;Engine for our backend, and the wonderful <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for our frontend.

    <h2 id="ahpcrc">AHPCRC Summer Institute</h2>
    <p>
    I conducted research and studied at the <a href="http://ahpcrc.stanford.edu/">Army High Performance Computing Research Center</a> during the 2014 Summer Institute at Stanford University.
    During these eight weeks, I studied various topics in math, computer science, and engineering, including optimization, partial differential equations, and computational mesh generation.
    I also worked on research, developing real-time physics simulations on low-powered Android tablets (see the <a href="/projects/physbam/">relevant project page</a> for more information).
    As part of this research, I developed a novel algorithm for distribution of points on a 3D triangulated mesh, following a provided UV density function.
    I received a verbal commendation on the excellence of my research report (available <a href="/files/ahpcrc_writeup.pdf">here</a>).

    <h2 id="lcm">League of Creative Minds</h2>
    <p>
    I worked with the <a href="http://lcmmun.org/">League of Creative Minds</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations">Model UN</a> debate organization, from 2011&ndash;2014, both as a student and as a secretariat member.
    </p>
    <p>
    As Undersecretary-General of Technology and Innovation, my work included audio/visual setup, networking, communications, and more.
    I developed Kiosk to fix some of the problems I saw arise (see the <a href="/projects/kiosk/">relevant project page</a> for more information), and earned the Model Diplomat award for its creation.
    I also delivered scientific and technical presentations to students in preparation for debates.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a student, I was also Head Delegate for two years.
    I won the Best Delegate award at WEMUN 2011 in Beijing, and the Most Persuasive Delegate award at MUNOS 2011 in Seoul.
